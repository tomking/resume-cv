# My Resume/CV

**Note: This repo is in its infancy. I have just migrated away from maintaining this material using InDesign (no tears were shed over that move), so I expect this to grow and change quite a bit as I lock in on a long term approach.**

This repository houses my resume/cv and associated tooling. This is not designed to be template for others to use, however it has aspects that were inspired by other well known Latex resume/cv templates.

The core idea behind the approach seen here is that I often need different versions of my resume, and regularly need to update resume versions and my cv. This repository allows me to do so through a common interface that gives flexibility and editability. This functions much better than maintaining something like this through a visual program since it separates the data and styles to some degree.

## Use/License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. You can do as you wish with it. It is not designed to be a template for your own resume/cv but I would be happy if others got use out of the work I put into it. Linking back to me/this repo is always appreciated if you found anything here to be helpful.
